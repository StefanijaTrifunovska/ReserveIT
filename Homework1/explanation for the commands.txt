At the beginning I access the folder “SAD” where the file Macedonia-latest.osm.pbf is located and I access the folder with these 2 commands:
-cd Desktop
-cd SAD
The next command that I use is the conversion from the file macedonia-latest.osm.pbf to macadonia.05m and the last command the was executed was for filtering the data and I redirected them to a csv file with with the following command:
“osmfilter macedonia.o5m --keep="amenity=restaurant amenity=bar amenity=pub amenity=grill amenity=lounge amenity=pizza amenity=fast_food amenity=cafe_-_bar amenity=coffe_shop amenity=fish_&_chips" | osmconvert - --all-to-nodes --csv="@id addr:city name addr:street @lat @lon" --csv-headline --csv-separator="," -o="test2.csv".
